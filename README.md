# Ranjith-sAppPortfolio
App description: My app portfolio for Android Nanodegree program
App author: Ranjith Ramachandran

This is the first app that I have developed as part of the submission process in the Android Nanodegree program. 
I have taken the liberty of customizing the title as I considered "My App Portfolio" to be confusing when there are so many
submissions. I have used styles.xml for buttons and strings.xml for all the strings used in the layout.
